Each thread on the server represents a client and waits for the client to respond, putting their message into a queue to send out to everyone else. The threads sleep while nothing is being sent to preserve CPU and are closed gracefully when there is a disconnect. The program is completely cross-platform, working on Windows and Unix operating systems.",

At the end, they can view a scoreboard of their favorite shoes tracked by my analytics system. <br><br>To make the demo, I created an architecture for an animation engine and event system using a state machine, which allowed me to fade in information for the user.
